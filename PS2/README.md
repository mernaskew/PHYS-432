For assignment 2, question 3 we simulated the leapfrog interaction of 4 neighboring vortex rings.

I collaborated with Spencer Geddes to complete this question. The code can be ran by running leapfrog.py in terminal, or the code can be ran by the jupyter notebook in case one or the other doesn't work.
